# refactorization of the code in a base class to avoid copy paste.
class BaseDeepQ(ABC):
    """
    This class aims at representing the Q value (or more in case of SAC) parametrization by
    a neural network.

    It is composed of 2 different networks:

    - model: which is the main model
    - target_model: which has the same architecture and same initial weights as "model" but is updated less frequently
      to stabilize training

    It has basic methods to make predictions, to train the model, and train the target model.

    This class is abstraction and need to be overide in order to create object from this class. The only pure virtual
    function is :func:`BaseDeepQ.construct_q_network` that creates the neural network from the nn_params
    (:class:`NNParam`) provided as input

    Attributes
    ----------
    _action_size: ``int``
        Total number of actions

    _observation_size: ``int``
        Size of the observation space considered

    _nn_archi: :class:`NNParam`
        The parameters of the neural networks that will be created

    _training_param: :class:`TrainingParam`
        The meta parameters for the training scheme (used especially for learning rate or gradient clipping for example)

    _lr: ``float``
        The  initial learning rate

    _lr_decay_steps: ``float``
        The decay step of the learning rate

    _lr_decay_rate: ``float``
        The rate at which the learning rate will decay

    _model:
        Main neural network model, here a keras Model object.

    _target_model:
        a copy of the main neural network that will be updated less frequently (also known as "target model" in RL
        community)
